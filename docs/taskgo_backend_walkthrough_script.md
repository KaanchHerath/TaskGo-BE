# 🎬 TaskGo Backend Walkthrough – Recording Script

## [0:00 – 0:20] Intro & High-Level Overview
**🎙️ Say:**  
"Hi, in this video I’ll walk you through the TaskGo backend codebase. TaskGo is a service marketplace platform where customers post tasks, and taskers apply, negotiate, and complete them.  
The backend is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and follows a modular architecture that makes it scalable and maintainable. Everything is neatly organized into routes, controllers, models, middleware, config, and utilities."

## [0:20 – 0:55] Server Setup & Middleware
**🎙️ Say:**  
"Everything starts in `server.js`. At the top [lines 1–26], you can see our imports — Express, Socket.IO, routers, and middlewares for security and file uploads.  

Then, from [lines 154–172], we register the global middleware stack. This includes Helmet for security, CORS configuration, file uploads via Multer, JSON parsing with a 50MB limit, and request logging.  

In [lines 175–189], we mount all API routes under `/api/*`, with each domain separated into its own router. And finally, from [lines 191–201], any unmatched route hits a 404, and the global error handler takes over. At the very end [lines 197–208], we connect to MongoDB and start the server."

**📹 Show code highlights:**  
- `src/server.js` → lines 1–26 (imports)  
- lines 154–172 (middleware stack)  
- lines 175–189 (route mounting)  
- lines 191–201 (404 + error handling)

## [0:55 – 1:25] Realtime Layer (Socket.IO)
**🎙️ Say:**  
"We also support realtime updates through Socket.IO. In `server.js`, lines [33–57] set up Socket.IO with environment-aware CORS.  

Authentication happens in [lines 59–86], where each socket is validated using a JWT. The user is fetched and attached to the socket object.  

Then in [lines 89–116], sockets join per-user rooms, which makes sure updates are only sent to the right user. This is how features like task status changes and application submissions notify users in real time.  

And if anything goes wrong at the engine level, lines [137–152] log errors for debugging."

**📹 Show code highlights:**  
- `src/server.js` → lines 33–57 (Socket.IO setup)  
- lines 59–86 (JWT socket auth)  
- lines 89–116 (room join)  
- lines 137–152 (engine error logging)

## [1:25 – 1:50] Routing & Controllers
**🎙️ Say:**  
"Let’s look at how routes and controllers work together. In `taskRoutes.js` [lines 26–37], we define public endpoints like `GET /tasks`. We also allow optional auth on single-task reads so that private visibility rules can be applied.  

From [lines 39–58], protected routes are defined — these all use the `verifyToken` middleware. Each route is mapped to a controller function, keeping routing thin and delegating business logic properly."

**📹 Show code highlights:**  
- `src/routes/taskRoutes.js` → lines 26–37 (public routes)  
- lines 39–58 (protected routes)  

**🎙️ Say (continued):**  
"In the controller, for example `getTasks` in `taskController.js` [lines 78–166], we build queries dynamically. We filter by category, area, and payment range, and apply role-based rules — like showing targeted tasks only to the intended tasker. The results also include application counts so customers can see interest at a glance."

**📹 Show code:**  
- `src/controllers/taskController.js` → lines 78–166 (getTasks function, call out lines 94–109 for targeted tasks and 124–146 for population and counts)  

---

## [1:50 – 2:10] Authentication & Security
**🎙️ Say:**  
"Authentication is handled with JWT. In `auth.js`, the `verifyToken` middleware [lines 57–80] extracts the token, validates it, and attaches the user to the request.  

We also have `optionalAuth` [lines 23–39] for cases where authentication is nice to have but not required, like reading a single task. And `authorize` [lines 82–89] is a simple role-based gate — for example, only customers can create tasks, while only taskers can apply."

**📹 Show code:**  
- `src/middleware/auth.js` → lines 23–39 (`optionalAuth`)  
- lines 57–80 (`verifyToken`)  
- lines 82–89 (`authorize`)  

---

## [2:10 – 2:35] Data Models & Validation
**🎙️ Say:**  
"Our MongoDB models use Mongoose to enforce validation and business rules.  

Here in `Task.js`, the schema [lines 3–27] defines fields like title and category, with enums ensuring valid categories. From [lines 28–47], payment ranges are validated so max can’t be less than min.  

The schema also validates agreed times [lines 64–75], ensures realistic dates [lines 91–114], and defines allowed statuses [lines 132–157].  

Performance is improved with indexes [lines 249–271], and a pre-save hook [lines 278–297] enforces that a scheduled task must have a selected tasker, agreed time, and agreed payment.  

We also define helpful methods [lines 299–353] like checking whether a task can be scheduled."

**📹 Show code highlights:**  
- `src/models/Task.js` → lines 3–27 (title/category), 28–47 (payments), 91–114 (date rules), 249–271 (indexes), 278–297 (pre-save hook), 299–353 (methods)

## [2:35 – 2:50] Error Handling & Wrap Up
**🎙️ Say:**  
"Finally, error handling is centralized in `errorHandler.js` [lines 1–51]. Validation errors, cast errors, and JWT errors are normalized into consistent JSON responses. The `notFoundHandler` [lines 53–59] ensures unknown routes always return a clean 404.  

So to wrap up — TaskGo’s backend is built on a clean Express–MongoDB architecture. We separate concerns into routes, controllers, models, and middleware, with real-time updates powered by Socket.IO. This makes the codebase easy to maintain, extend, and scale, while keeping security and reliability at the core."
